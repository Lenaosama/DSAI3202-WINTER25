# Lab 3: Parallel and Distributed Computing

## Objectives:
- Implement data parallel models using threads and processes.
- Measure execution times for different parallelization strategies.
- Analyze performance differences between sequential, threading, and multiprocessing approaches.

## Tasks:
1. Implement sequential summation of numbers from 1 to a large number.
2. Implement parallel summation using threads.
3. Implement parallel summation using multiprocessing.
4. Measure and compare execution times for all approaches.
5. Calculate performance metrics such as speedup and efficiency.

## Structure:
- `src/`: Contains the source code for sequential, threading, and multiprocessing implementations.
- `test/`: Contains test scripts for validating the implementations.
- `main.py`: The entry point for executing the lab tasks.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.

## How to Run:
1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
