# DSAI3202-WINTER25
# Temperature Sensor Simulation

## Project Description
This project simulates multiple temperature sensors that continuously provide temperature readings. The readings are processed to calculate averages, and the results are displayed on the console. The program uses threading to simulate real-time data collection and processing.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/temperature-sensor-simulation.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd temperature-sensor-simulation
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To run the program, execute the following command:
```bash
python main.py
