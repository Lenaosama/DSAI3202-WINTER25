# DSAI3202-WINTER25
# Temperature Sensor Simulation

## Project Description
This project simulates multiple temperature sensors that continuously provide temperature readings. The readings are processed to calculate averages, and the results are displayed on the console. The program uses threading to simulate real-time data collection and processing.

## Usage
To run the program, execute the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
