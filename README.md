# Project Title
Image Processing for Tumor Detection

# Description
This project focuses on detecting tumors using image processing techniques. It involves preprocessing medical images, applying filters, and using machine learning models for tumor classification.

# Features
Image preprocessing (grayscale conversion, noise reduction, contrast enhancement)
Feature extraction using image processing techniques
Tumor classification using machine learning models
Visualization of processed images and detection results

## How to Run the Code
### Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
### Run the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook ImageProcessingForTumorDetection.ipynb

# Results
The model successfully identifies tumor regions with high accuracy.
Image processing enhances contrast and feature detection for better classification.
