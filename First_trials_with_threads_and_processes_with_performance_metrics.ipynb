    "- Adding **two threads** improved things slightly (**6.73s for numbers, 6.02s for letters**), but not significantly.  \n",
    "- **Multiprocessing**, on the other hand, was much faster (**2.96s**), showing a clear advantage for CPU-heavy tasks.  \n",

    "#### **Speedup & Efficiency – Was Parallelization Worth It?**  \n",
    "- **Threads** gave a tiny speed boost (**1.01x faster**), with an efficiency of **25.3%**—not great.  \n",
    "- **Processes** were **2.28x faster** and had a much better efficiency of **57.1%**.  \n",

    "- **Threads aren’t useful** for tasks that rely heavily on the CPU, but they’re good for I/O-bound tasks.  \n",
    "- **Multiprocessing is the way to go** for CPU-heavy tasks since it takes full advantage of multiple cores.  \n",
